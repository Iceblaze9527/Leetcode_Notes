### [708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/)
#### Description
Given a Circular Linked List `node`, which is sorted in non-descending order, write a function to insert a value `insertVal` into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list and may not necessarily be the smallest value in the circular list.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is `null`), you should create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the originally given node.

#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5*10**4]`
- `-10**6<=Node.val,insertVal<=10**6`

#### Solution
As simple as the problem might seem to be, it is actually not trivial to write a solution that covers all cases.

> **Case 1).** The value of new node sits between the minimal and maximal values of the current list. As a result, it should be inserted within the list.
> **Case 2).** The value of new node goes beyond the minimal and maximal values of the current list, either less than the minimal value or greater than the maximal value. In either case, the new node should be added right after the tail node (i.e. the node with the maximal value of the list).
> **Case 3).** Empty List

```python=!
class Solution:
    def insert(self, head: 'Optional[Node]', insertVal: int) -> 'Node':
        if not head:
            head = ListNode(insertVal)
            head.next = head
            return head
        
        pred, curr = head, head.next
        
        while pred.next != head:
            if (pred.val <= insertVal <= curr.val):
                break
            elif pred.val > curr.val:
                if insertVal > pred.val or insertVal < curr.val:
                    break
            pred, curr = pred.next, curr.next
        
        pred.next = ListNode(insertVal,curr)
        
        return head
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity $O (N)$:** where $N$ is the size of list. In the worst case, we would iterate through the entire list.
- **Space Complexity $O(1)$:** It is a constant space solution.

### [1089-Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/)
#### Description
Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

#### Constraints
```python
1 <= arr.length <= 10**4
0 <= arr[i] <= 9
```

#### Solution
There are A LOT of edge cases out of nowhere and there is no elegant solution.
* edge cases usually appear at where loop condition fails
* when mimicking the process, follow a sequencial pattern, i.e. everything changed has to be listed

```python=
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """
        left = 0
        dups = 0
        n = len(arr)
        
        # count duplicates
        while left + dups <= n - 1:
            if arr[left] == 0:
                dups += 1
            left += 1
        
        # tackling the edge cases
        left -= 1
        if left + dups == n:
            arr[-1] = 0
            dups -= 1
            left -= 1
        
        # duplicate zeros and move elements
        for right in range(left,-1,-1):
            arr[right+dups] = arr[right]
            if arr[right] == 0:
                arr[right+dups-1] = 0
                dups -= 1
```

**Official Solution:**
```python=
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """

        possible_dups = 0
        length_ = len(arr) - 1

        # Find the number of zeros to be duplicated
        for left in range(length_ + 1):

            # Stop when left points beyond the last element in the original list
            # which would be part of the modified list
            if left > length_ - possible_dups:
                break

            # Count the zeros
            if arr[left] == 0:
                # Edge case: This zero can't be duplicated. We have no more space,
                # as left is pointing to the last element which could be included  
                if left == length_ - possible_dups:
                    arr[length_] = 0 # For this zero we just copy it without duplication.
                    length_ -= 1
                    break
                possible_dups += 1

        # Start backwards from the last element which would be part of new list.
        last = length_ - possible_dups

        # Copy zero twice, and non zero once.
        for i in range(last, -1, -1):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                arr[i + possible_dups] = 0
                possible_dups -= 1
                arr[i + possible_dups] = 0
            else:
                arr[i + possible_dups] = arr[i]
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of elements in the array. We do two passes through the array, one to find the number of `possible_dups` and the other to copy the elements. In the worst case we might be iterating the entire array, when there are less or no zeros in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$. We do not use any extra space.
