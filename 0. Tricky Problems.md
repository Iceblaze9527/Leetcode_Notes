### [708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/)
#### Description
Given a Circular Linked List `node`, which is sorted in non-descending order, write a function to insert a value `insertVal` into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list and may not necessarily be the smallest value in the circular list.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is `null`), you should create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the originally given node.

#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5*10**4]`
- `-10**6<=Node.val,insertVal<=10**6`

#### Solution
As simple as the problem might seem to be, it is actually not trivial to write a solution that covers all cases.

> **Case 1).** The value of new node sits between the minimal and maximal values of the current list. As a result, it should be inserted within the list.
> **Case 2).** The value of new node goes beyond the minimal and maximal values of the current list, either less than the minimal value or greater than the maximal value. In either case, the new node should be added right after the tail node (i.e. the node with the maximal value of the list).
> **Case 3).** Empty List

```python=!
class Solution:
    def insert(self, head: 'Optional[Node]', insertVal: int) -> 'Node':
        if not head:
            head = ListNode(insertVal)
            head.next = head
            return head
        
        pred, curr = head, head.next
        
        while pred.next != head:
            if (pred.val <= insertVal <= curr.val):
                break
            elif pred.val > curr.val:
                if insertVal > pred.val or insertVal < curr.val:
                    break
            pred, curr = pred.next, curr.next
        
        pred.next = ListNode(insertVal,curr)
        
        return head
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity $O (N)$:** where $N$ is the size of list. In the worst case, we would iterate through the entire list.
- **Space Complexity $O(1)$:** It is a constant space solution.

### [1089-Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/)
#### Description
Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

#### Constraints
```python
1 <= arr.length <= 10**4
0 <= arr[i] <= 9
```

#### Solution
This is a very annoying problem despite seemingly simple. There is no elegant solution. The edge case lies in unsatiated duplicates:

> An example of the edge case is - [8,4,5,0,0,0,0,7]. In this array there is space to accommodate the duplicates of first and second occurrences of zero. But we don't have enough space for the duplicate of the third occurrence of zero. Hence when we are copying we need to make sure for the third occurrence we don't copy twice. Result = [8,4,5,0,0,0,0,0]

```python=!
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """
        left = 0
        dups = 0
        n = len(arr)
        
        # count duplicates
        while left + dups <= n - 1:## beware of the criterion
            if arr[left] == 0:
                dups += 1
            left += 1
        
        left -= 1 #left is one step ahead of the last to-be-duplicated item (this is easier to handle if we use for loops in C language ahh)
        if left + dups == n: # tackling the edge cases
            arr[-1] = 0
            left -= 1
            dups -= 1
        
        # duplicate zeros and move elements
        for right in range(left,-1,-1):
            arr[right + dups] = arr[right]
            if arr[right] == 0:
                arr[right + dups - 1] = 0
                dups -= 1
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of elements in the array. We do two passes through the array, one to find the number of `possible_dups` and the other to copy the elements. In the worst case we might be iterating the entire array, when there are less or no zeros in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$. We do not use any extra space.
