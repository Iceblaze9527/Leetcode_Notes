## 3.1.1 Notes
:::info
**Linked Lists vs Arrays**
If you need to add or delete a node frequently, a linked list could be a good choice.

If you need to access an element by index often, an array might be a better choice than a linked list.

**Always examine if the node is null before you call the next field.**
Getting the next node of a null node will cause the null-pointer error. For example, before we run `fast = fast.next.next`, we need to examine both `fast` and `fast.next` is not null.

**Carefully define the end conditions of your loop.**
Run several examples to make sure your end conditions will not result in an endless loop. And you have to take our first tip into consideration when you define your end conditions.

## 3.1.2 [Singly Linked List Class](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)
### Description
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: `val` and `next`. `val` is the value of the current node, and `next` is a pointer/reference to the next node.

Implement the `MyLinkedList` class:
- `MyLinkedList()` Initializes the `MyLinkedList` object.
- `int get(int index)` Get the value of the `index`^th node in the linked list. If the `index` is invalid, return `-1`.
- `void addAtHead(int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
- `void addAtTail(int val)` Append a node of value `val` as the last element of the linked list.
- `void addAtIndex(int index, int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the `index`^th node in the linked list. If `index` equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If `index` is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
- `void deleteAtIndex(int index)` Delete the `index`^th node in the linked list, if the `index` is valid.

### Constraints
- `0<=index.val<=1000`
- Please do not use the built-in LinkedList library.
- At most 2000 calls will be made to `get`,`addAtHead`, `addAtTail`, `addAtIndex` and `deleteAtIndex`.

### Solution
```python=!
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

class MyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 0
        self.head = ListNode(0) # sentinel node

    def get(self, index: int) -> int:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return -1
        
        curr = self.head
        for _ in range(index+1):
            curr = curr.next
            
        return curr.val

    """
    Add a node of value val before the index^th node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
    """
    def addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            return
        
        pred = self.head
        for _ in range(index):
            pred = pred.next
        
        curr = ListNode(val)
        curr.next = pred.next
        pred.next = curr
        
        self.size += 1
    
    """
    Delete the index^th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.
    """
    def deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return
        
        pred = self.head
        for _ in range(index):
            pred = pred.next
        
        pred.next = pred.next.next
        
        self.size -= 1
```

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ for `addAtHead`. $\mathcal{O}(k)$ for `get`, `addAtIndex`, and `deleteAtIndex`, where $k$ is an index of the element to get, add or delete. $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for `addAtTail`.

#### Space complexity
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ for all operations.

## 3.1.2 [Doubly Linked List Class](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)
### Description
Same as the singly linked list, except that you will need one more attribute `prev` to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement the `MyLinkedList` class:
- `MyLinkedList()` Initializes the `MyLinkedList` object.
- `int get(int index)` Get the value of the `index`^th node in the linked list. If the `index` is invalid, return `-1`.
- `void addAtHead(int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
- `void addAtTail(int val)` Append a node of value `val` as the last element of the linked list.
- `void addAtIndex(int index, int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the `index`^th node in the linked list. If `index` equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If `index` is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
- `void deleteAtIndex(int index)` Delete the `index`^th node in the linked list, if the `index` is valid.

### Constraints
- `0<=index.val<=1000`
- Please do not use the built-in LinkedList library.
- At most 2000 calls will be made to `get`,`addAtHead`, `addAtTail`, `addAtIndex` and `deleteAtIndex`.


### Solution
```python=!
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

class MyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 0
        # sentinel nodes as pseudo-head and pseudo-tail
        self.head, self.tail = ListNode(0), ListNode(0) 
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head

    def get(self, index: int) -> int:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return -1
        
        if index + 1 < self.size - index:
            curr = self.head
            for _ in range(index + 1):
                curr = curr.next
        else:
            curr = self.tail
            for _ in range(self.size - index):
                curr = curr.prev
            
        return curr.val

    def addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            return
        
        # find predecessor and successor of the node to be added
        if index < self.size - index:
            pred = self.head
            for _ in range(index):
                pred = pred.next
            succ = pred.next
        else:
            succ = self.tail
            for _ in range(self.size - index):
                succ = succ.prev
            pred = succ.prev
        
        curr = ListNode(val)
        
        curr.prev = pred
        curr.next = succ
        pred.next = curr
        succ.prev = curr
        
        self.size += 1

    def deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return
        
        if index < self.size - index:
            pred = self.head
            for _ in range(index):
                pred = pred.next
            succ = pred.next.next
        else:
            succ = self.tail
            for _ in range(self.size - index - 1):

        pred.next = succ
        succ.prev = pred
            
        self.size -= 1
```

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ for `addAtHead` and `addAtTail`. $\mathcal{O}(\min(k,N-k))$ for `get`, `addAtIndex`, and `deleteAtindex`, where $k$ is an index of the element to get, add or delete.

#### Space complexity
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ for all operations.

## 3.1.3 Trick: Sentinel Nodes
Sentinel nodes are widely used in the trees and linked lists as pseudo-heads, pseudo-tails, etc. They serve as the guardians, as the name suggests, and usually they do not hold any data.

### Create: [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
#### Description
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1,100]`.
- `0<=Node.val<=9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

#### Solution
```python=!
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(0)
        
        pt = sentinel
        pt1, pt2 = l1, l2
        carry = 0
        
        while pt1 or pt2 or carry:
            val1 = pt1.val if pt1 else 0
            val2 = pt2.val if pt2 else 0
            
            carry, digit = divmod(val1 + val2 + carry, 10)
            
            pt.next = ListNode(digit)
            
            pt = pt.next
            pt1 = pt1.next if pt1 else None
            pt2 = pt2.next if pt2 else None

        return sentinel.next
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time complexity $O(\max(m,n))$:** Assume that $m$ and $n$ represents the length of `l1` and `l2` respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most $\max(m,n)$ times.
- **Space complexity $O(\max(m,n))$:** The length of the new list is at most $\max(m,n)+1$.

### Delete: [203. Remove Linked List Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)
#### Description
Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has `Node.val == val`, and return the new head.

#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0,10**4]`.
- `1<=Node.val<=50`
- `0<=val<=50`

#### Solution
Deletion should use the predecessor of the target node, so we use a sentinel node for convenience.

```python=!
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(0,head)
        pred = sentinel
        
        while pred and pred.next:
            if pred.next.val == val:
                pred.next = pred.next.next
            else:
                pred = pred.next
        
        return sentinel.next
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time complexity $O(N)$**, it's one pass solution.
- **Space complexity $O(1)$**, it's a constant space solution.
